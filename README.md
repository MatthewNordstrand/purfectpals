## About

This website was created using Bootstrap for my portfolio. It is an example of a potential pet adoption service. It contains call to actions to drive the user to adopting a pet, or to donating through the multi-tier donation portion.

## Some Code Examples

[Donation Page](https://github.com/MatthewNordstrand/purfectpals/blob/main/donate.html) - This page uses a similar style that many sites use nowadays for their donation services. There are multiple tiers all right next to each other, and the user can select the one that they see fit. You'll see this design on many SAAS (Software as a Service) services.

[About Page](https://github.com/MatthewNordstrand/purfectpals/blob/main/about.html) - This page uses an accordion to display all of the FAQs at once, and expanding on one of them when a user selects on that they would like to know about more. This design is used on many FAQ pages today.

[Adoption Form](https://github.com/MatthewNordstrand/purfectpals/blob/main/adopt.html) - This page is for the adoption for for the website. It shows an easy way that we can collect information about a user to potentially do business with them. In that case, get them to adopt one of our animals.
